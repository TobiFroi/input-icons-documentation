# Base Setup (for Sprites and UI Images)

With the setup window open (Tools/Input Icons/Input Icons Setup), define the control scheme names you want to use in your Input Action Assets.

We have separate lists for keyboard and gamepad control schemes to better differentiate between these two device types.

## Control Scheme Names

Define as many control scheme names as you need, but we recommend using as few as possible and reusing them in your Input Action Assets if you have several.

## Action Assets for Rebinding

If you want to let users rebind their keys, fill the Used Action Assets list with your asset(s). The tool will automatically save/load the overridden bindings when necessary.
